## What is the `tidyverse`?

> The `tidyverse` is an .highlight[opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science]. All packages share an .highlight[underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures] ([Tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).

> The `tidyverse` is a .highlight[coherent system of packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization] that share a .highlight[common design philosophy] ([Rickert, 2017](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/)).

```{r, out.width = "25%", echo = FALSE}
include_picture("hex-tidyverse.png")
```

---

## Benefits of the `tidyverse`

.large[
Most of the things we are going to show you can also be achieved with base `R`. However, the syntax for this is typically (more) verbose and not intuitive and, hence, difficult to learn, remember, and read (plus many `tidyverse` operations are faster than their base `R` equivalents).
]

---

## Benefits of the `tidyverse`

.large[  
`Tidyverse` syntax is designed to increase **human-readability**. This makes it especially **attractive for `R` novices** as it can facilitate the experience of **self-efficacy** (see [Robinson, 2017](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)). The `tidyverse` also aims for **consistency** (e.g., data frame as first argument and output) and uses **smarter defaults** (e.g., no partial matching of data frame and column names).
]

---

## `tidyverse` for `R` beginners

```{r tidy meme, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
meme_get("DistractedBf") %>% 
  meme_text_distbf("tidyverse", "new R users", "base R")
```

```{r tidy meme print, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%"}
include_picture("/DistractedBf.png") 
```

## Workflow

include_picture("data-science.png")
```
]
<small><small>Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/</small></small>

.highlight[- **Import**: read in data in different formats (e.g., .csv, .xls, .sav, .dta)
- **Tidy**: clean data (1 row = 1 case, 1 column = 1 variable), rename & recode variables, etc.
- **Transform**: prepare data for analysis (e.g., by aggregating and/or filtering)]
- **Visualize**: explore/analyze data through informative plots
- **Model**: analyze the data by creating models (e.g, linear regression model) 
- **Communicate**: present the results (to others)

## Lift-off into the `tidyverse` `r ji("rocket")`
**Install all `tidyverse` packages** (for the full list of `tidyverse` packages see [https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/))
```{r install tidyverse, eval = F, echo = T}
install.packages("tidyverse")

```
**Load core `tidyverse` packages** (NB: To save time and reduce namespace conflicts it can make sense to load the `tidyverse` packages individually)

```{r load tidyverse, eval = T, echo = T, message = T}
library("tidyverse")

```

---

## `tidyverse` vocab 101

We will focus on three key things here:

1. Tidy data

2. Tibbles

3. Pipes

---

## Tidy data

The 3 rules of tidy data:

1. Each **variable** is in a separate **column**.

2. Each **observation** is in a separate **row**.

3. Each **value** is in a separate **cell**.


```{r tidy-data, echo = FALSE}
include_picture("tidy_data.png")
```
Source: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html

*NB*: In the `tidyverse` terminology 'tidy data' usually also means data in long format (where applicable). 

---

## Wide vs. long format

```{r wide-long-pic, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
include_picture("wide-long.png")
```
Source: https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain#tidy-data

---

## Tibbles

.pull-left[
Tibbles are basically just `R data.frames` but nicer.

- only the first ten observations are printed
  - output is tidier!
  
- you get some additional metadata about rows and columns that you would normally only get when using `dim()` and other functions

You can check the [tibble vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html) for technical details.
]

.pull-right[
```{r tibble-pic, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
include_picture("tibble.png")
```
]

---

## A `data.frame`

.small[
```{r data-frame-print, echo = FALSE}
data("USArrests")

USArrests
```
]


---

## A `tibble`

.small[
```{r tibble-print, echo = FALSE}
tibble::as_tibble(USArrests)
```
]

---

## Converting dataframes into tibbles

You can convert any `data.frame` into a `tibble`:

```{r tibble-convert, eval = FALSE}
data("USArrests")

tibble::as_tibble(USArrests)
```

.small[
```{r tibble-convert-print, echo = FALSE}
data("USArrests")

tibble::as_tibble(USArrests)
```
]

---

## The logic of pipes

Usually, in `R` we apply functions as follows:

```{r function-r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
f(x)
```

In the logic of pipes this function is written as:

```{r function-pipe, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% f(.)
```

--

We can use pipes on more than one function:

```{r function-pipe-2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% 
  f_1() %>% 
  f_2() %>% 
  f_3()
```

More details: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html

---

## Pipes everywhere...

```{r pipe meme, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(memer)

meme_get("OprahGiveaway") %>% 
  meme_text_bottom("EVERYONE GETS A %>%!!!", size = 36)
```

```{r pipe-meme-include, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
include_picture("OprahGiveaway.png")
```

---

## Resources

There are hundreds of tutorials, courses, blog posts, etc. about the `tidyverse` available online. The book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and [Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/statgarrett) (which is available for free online) provides a very comprehensive introduction to the `tidyverse`.

The weekly [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data projects and the associated [#tidytuesday Twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday?lang=en) are also a fun way of learning and practicing data wrangling and exploration with the `tidyverse`.

---

## Cheatsheets

*RStudio* offers a good collection of [cheatsheets for R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

The following two are of particular interest for this workshop:

- [Data Import Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf)

- [Data Transformation Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)

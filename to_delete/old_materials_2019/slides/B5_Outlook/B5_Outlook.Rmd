# Where to go from here?

Some topics that we did not cover or only briefly touched upon that you might want to explore next/further:

- working with strings (with [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/index.html))

- working with factors (with [`forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/))

- working with times and dates (with [`lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/))

- working with labelled data (with [`haven`](https://github.com/tidyverse/haven) and [`sjlabelled`](https://github.com/strengejacke/sjlabelled))

- advanced plotting with [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

- tidy modeling (using the [`broom`](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom) package)

- reporting & publishing (with [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr))

- functional programming (with the [`purrr` package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/))

# Acknowledgements `r ji("heart")`

All slides were created with the `R` package [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) which builds on [`remark.js`](https://remarkjs.com), [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr), and [`R Markdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The exercises were created with the [`unilur` package](https://github.com/koncina/unilur).  

The `workshop.css` file we used for the layout of the slides includes elements from `CSS` files for `xaringan` presentations by [Frederik Aust](https://github.com/crsh) and [David Zimmer](https://github.com/DavZim).  

We thank Anne Carome from *RStudio* for sending us some nice hex stickers for this workshop, Claudia O'Donovan-Bellante and her team for taking good care of the organization of this workshop, and all of you for participating!

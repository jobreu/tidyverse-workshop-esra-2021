# About this course

.larger[
In this course you will learn how to **wrangle and explore data in R using packages from the `tidyverse`**. At the end of the course, you should be be familiar with the concepts of **tidy data** and the **pipe operator**, able to **import, transform, and explore** data with the `tidyverse`, and comfortable rewriting base R syntax in **`tidyverse` syntax**.

# What to expect

- The structure of this workshop largely follows a typical workflow (for tabular data)

- This is not a statistics workshop!
    - Plumbing (skills for wrangling & exploring) instead of engineering (knowledge about stats)
    
```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("./pics/mario_brick_3d.png")
```

- You will become a super (data) plumber who knows how to use pipes

# Why do we focus on wrangling & exploring?

.large[The (in)famous **80/20-rule**: 80% wrangling, 20% analysis]<sup>1</sup>  
  
  
> Given almost every data task, you’ll almost certainly need to .highlight[clean your data, visualize it, and do some exploratory data analysis] Moreover, .highlight[they are also important as you move into more advanced topics.] Do you want to start doing machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning? You had better know how to clean and explore a dataset. If you can’t, you’ll basically be lost ([Sharp Sight Labs, 2017](https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/first-step-data-science-top-performer/)).

.footnote[
[1] Of course, this ratio relates to the time the working time of the analyst, not computing time.

# What is the `tidyverse`?

> The `tidyverse` is an .highlight[opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science]. All packages share an .highlight[underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures] ([Tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).

> The `tidyverse` is a .highlight[coherent system of packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization] that share a .highlight[common design philosophy] ([Rickert, 2017](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/)).

# Benefits of the `tidyverse`

.large[Most of the things we are going to show you can also be achieved with base R. However, the syntax for this is typically (more) verbose and not intuitive and, hence, difficult to learn, remember, and read (plus many `tidyverse` operations are faster than their base R equivalents).  
  
`Tidyverse` syntax is designed to increase **human-readability**. This makes it especially **attractive for R novices** as it can facilitate the experience of **self-efficacy** (see [Robinson, 2017](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)). The `tidyverse` also aims for **consistency** (e.g., data frame as first argument and output) and uses **smarter defaults** (e.g., `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` & no partial matching of data frame and column names).]

# Workflow

.center[
<img src="./pics/data-science.png" width="60%">
]
<small><small>Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/</small></small>

.highlight[- **Import**: read in data in different formats (e.g., .csv, .xls, .sav, .dta)
- **Tidy**: clean data (1 row = 1 case, 1 column = 1 variable), rename & recode variables, etc.
- **Transform**: prepare data for analysis (e.g., by aggregating and/or filtering)
- **Visualize**: explore/analyze data through informative plots]
- **Model**: analyze the data by creating models (e.g, linear regression model) 
- **Communicate**: present the results (to others)

# The expanding `tidyverse`

There is a long and continuously growing list of packages that implement/adapt `tidyverse` principles and workflows for different types of analyses.  

Some examples:
- [`tidygraph`](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/) for a tidy approach to network analysis

- [`tidytext`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html) for a [tidy approach to text mining](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)

- [`tidybayes`](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/index.html) for tidy Bayesian analyses

- [`tidymlm`](https://github.com/mkearney/tidymlm) for tidy multilevel modeling

- [`tidysem`](https://github.com/mkearney/tidysem) for tidy structural equation modeling

---

# Lift-off into the `tidyverse` `r ji("rocket")`
**install all `tidyverse` packages** (for the full list of `tidyverse` packages see [https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/))
```{r install tidyverse, eval = F, echo = T}
install.packages("tidyverse")

```
**load core `tidyverse` packages** (NB: To save time and reduce namespace conflicts it can make sense to load the `tidyverse` packages individually)
```{r load tidyverse, eval = T, echo = T, message = T}
library("tidyverse")

```

---

# Cheat sheets

*RStudio* offers a good collection of [cheat sheets for R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

The following ones are of particular interest for this workshop:

- [Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf)

- [Data Transformation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)

- [Data Visualization Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

# Coding in style `r ji("sunglasses")`

[The `tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) by Hadley Wickham  
  
[`styler`](http://styler.r-lib.org/) package (incl. RStudio add-in)

```{r install & load styler, eval = F, echo = T}
install.packages("styler")
library(styler)

```

From the package documentation:
- `style_file()` styles .R and/or .Rmd files.
- `style_dir()` styles all .R and/or .Rmd files in a directory.

```{r, out.width = "50%"}

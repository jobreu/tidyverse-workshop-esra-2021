# Titanic `r ji("passenger_ship")`

For the data wrangling examples in this session and the following one we will use the Titanic dataset from [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)

```{r titanic data, include = F}
titanic <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv")
```


```{r read titanic codebook, include = F}
titanic_codebook <- read_csv2("../../data/titanic/titanic_codebook.csv")
```

```{r titanic codebook}
titanic_codebook %>%
  kable("html") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 16)
```

---

# Side note: Codebooks

If you want to generate a codebook for your dataset, there are several options:

- The [`codebook` package](https://github.com/rubenarslan/codebook) which includes an *RStudio*-Addin and also offers a [web app](https://rubenarslan.ocpu.io/codebook/www/)

- the `makeCodebook()` function from the [`dataMaid` package](https://github.com/ekstroem/dataMaid) (see this [blog post](http://sandsynligvis.dk/articles/18/codebook.html) for a short tutorial)

- the `codebook()` function from the [`memisc` package](https://github.com/melff/memisc)

---

# Data frame check

It's always good to first check how clean or messy your data is and whether or where it needs cleaning.  

The `glimpse()` function from `dplyr` is usually a good start as it is similar to `str()` base R but tries to display as many data points as possible (in the Console).  

The second thing you could/should do (esp. if you have many/mostly numeric variables) is to use the `summary()` function from base R.  

If you want more detailed summaries of your data, you can have a look at the [`skimr`](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr) and [`summarytools`](https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools) packages.

---

# Data frame check 1

```{r glimpse, echo = T}
glimpse(titanic)
```

---

# Data frame check 2

```{r summary_df, include = F}
titanic_num <- titanic %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric)
```

```{r summary, echo = T}
summary(titanic_num)
```

---

# `dplyr` functions

.large[
- `dplyr` functions are verbs that signal an action  

- first argument = a data frame  

- output normally also a data frame (tibble) 

- columns (= variables in a tidy data frame) can be referenced without quotation marks (non-standard evaluation)
]

---

# Renaming variables

```{r titanic head rename, echo = T}
names(titanic)
```

Some of the names of in the Titanic dataset are difficult to understand (without consulting the codebook).

---

# Renaming variables

It is generally helpful to use a consistent naming scheme. As `R` is case-sensitive, we might want to only use lowercase letters. As spaces in variable names can cause problems (or at least headaches), we could opt for `r ji("snake")` snake_case (`r ji("camel")` camelCase is a common alternative; for a good brief discussion of options for avoiding spaces in variable names, see this [Medium post by Patrick Divine](https://medium.com/@pddivine/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841)).

Note: For common data cleaning tasks, you might also want to have a look at the [`janitor` package](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) which is `tidyverse`-oriented and includes the function `clean_names()`.  

---
--- 

# `dplyr::rename`

```{r titanic rename, echo = T}
titanic <- titanic %>% 
  rename(passenger_id = PassengerId,
         survived = Survived,
         ticket_class = Pclass,
         name = Name,
         sex = Sex,
         age = Age,
         nr_of_siblings_spouses_aboard = SibSp,
         nr_of_parents_children_aboard = Parch,
         ticket_number = Ticket,
         fare = Fare,
         cabin_nr = Cabin,
         port_of_embarkation = Embarked)

names(titanic)
```

---

# Selecting variables

Very often we do not need all the variables in a dataset for our analyses. We can create a selection of columns/variables with the `dplyr` verb `select()`.

```{r select, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(passenger_id, sex, age, ticket_class, survived)
```

---

# Select & rename

You can also combine the steps of selecting and renaming variables.

```{r select & rename, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(id = passenger_id, survivor = survived, sex, age)
```

---

# Selecting a range of variables

```{r select range, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(name:age)
```

.small[
Note: You can also select variables by their index

```{r select index, eval = F, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(4:6)
```
]

---

# Unselecting variables

```{r unselect, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(-survived)
```

---

# Unselecting a range of variables

```{r unselect range, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(-(name:port_of_embarkation))
```

---

# Filtering cases

With the `filter()` function from `dplyr` you can filter rows/observations dependent on one or more conditions.

You can use the usual operators for 
- **comparisons**:
    - **<** (smaller than)
    - **<=** (smaller than or equal to)
    - **==** (equal to)
    - **!=** (not equal to)
    - **>=** (larger than or equal to)
    - **>** (larger than)  
    
- **logical operators**:
    - **&** (and)
    - **|** (or)
    - **!** (not)
    - **xor** (either or, not both)

---

# `dplyr::filter` - one condition

```{r filter 1, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  filter(sex == "male")
```

.small[
Note: If you want to filter rows based on their index, you need to use `slice()` instead of `filter()`.
]
---

# `dplyr::filter` - multiple conditions

```{r filter 2, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  filter(sex == "male", survived == 1, age >= 18)
```

---

# `dplyr::filter` - multiple conditions

By default, multiple conditions in `filter()` are added as & (and). You can, however, also specify multiple conditions differently.

**or** (cases for which at least one of the conditions is true)

```{r filter or, echo = T, eval = F}
titanic %>% 
  filter(nr_of_siblings_spouses_aboard > 0 | 
           nr_of_parents_children_aboard > 0)
```

**xor** (cases for which only one of the two conditions is true)

```{r filter xor, echo = T, eval = F}
titanic %>% 
  filter(xor(nr_of_siblings_spouses_aboard > 0, 
             nr_of_parents_children_aboard > 0))
```

---

# Creating new variables

In the process of preparing data for analyses, we usually want to create new variables (often based on existing ones). For example, in the Titanic dataset, we might want to calculate the total number of relatives aboard the Titanic for each passenger. You can do this with the `mutate()` function.

```{r Titanic mutate sum relatives, echo = T}
titanic <- titanic %>% 
  mutate(nr_of_relatives_aboard = nr_of_siblings_spouses_aboard + #<<
           nr_of_parents_children_aboard) #<<

titanic %>% 
  select(nr_of_relatives_aboard) %>% 
  filter(nr_of_relatives_aboard > 1) %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

---

# `dplyr::mutate`

There are many operators and helper functions that you can use to create and transform variables with `mutate()`.

* change of variable types: `as.numeric()`, `as.factor()`, ...

* arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `^`, `%%` (modulo), `%/%` (integer division)

* aggregate functions: `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()`, ...

* logs: `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`

* offsets: `lead()`, `lag()`

* cumulative aggregates: `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummean()`, ...

* logical comparisons: `<=`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`

* ranks: `min_rank()`, `ntile()`, ...

Note: If you only want to keep the newly created variables, you should use `transmute()` instead of `mutate()`.

---

# Recoding variable values

```{r Titanic embark}
titanic %>% 
  select(port_of_embarkation) %>% 
  head()
```

Without looking at the codebook, it is not clear what the letters in the *Embarked* variable stand for. If we want to, e.g., produce tables or plots using this variable, it might help to replace the abbreviation by the full name of the port of embarkation.

---

# `dplyr::recode`

```{r recode, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  mutate(port_of_embarkation = recode(port_of_embarkation, #<<
         S = "Southampton", #<<
         C = "Cherbourg", #<<
         Q = "Queenstown")) %>% #<< 
  select(port_of_embarkation) %>% 
  head()
```

Note that we recode into the same variable here. If we wanted to create a new variable with the recoded values, we would simply have to give it a different name.

---

# Missing values

In the real world (of data collection and analysis) it is quite rare to have datasets without missing data. When we prepare our data for analysis there are generally two things we might want/have to do with regard to missing values:

- define specific values as missings

- recode `NA` values into something else (for example, to distinguish between different types of missing values)

Note: An interesting option for exploring and working with missing data is the [`naniar` package](http://naniar.njtierney.com/) which, according to its documentation, "provides principled, tidy ways to summarise, visualise, and manipulate missing data".  

---

# Recode `NA` into something else with `tidyr::replace_na`

```{r missing example}
titanic %>% 
  select(cabin_nr) %>% 
  head(n = 3)
```

```{r recode NAs, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  mutate(cabin_nr = replace_na(cabin_nr, "unknown")) %>% #<<
  select(cabin_nr) %>% 
  head(n = 3)
```

---

# Recode specific values as `NA` with `dplyr::na_if`

```{r recode NAs 2}
titanic <- titanic %>% 
  mutate(cabin_nr = replace_na(cabin_nr, "unknown"))

titanic %>% 
  select(cabin_nr) %>% 
  head(n = 3)
```

```{r recode as NA, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  mutate(cabin_nr = na_if(cabin_nr, "unknown")) %>% #<<
  select(cabin_nr) %>% 
  head(n = 3)
```

---

# Rearranging a dataset

There are two dimensions in tabular datasets along which you can (re-)order them: **columns** (variables) and **rows** (observations).  

We have already explored the `tidyr` functions `gather()` and `spread()` for changing data from wide to long format and vice versa.

However, sometimes you just want to change the order of the columns (variables) and/or rows (observations) in your dataset.

---

# Reordering columns in a dataset

As you might have noticed in some of the first examples for that function, you can use `select()` to reorder columns (the order in which you select them determines their order in the new dataframe). If you just want to move a few columns to the beginning of your dataframe, you can use `everything()`.

```{r select + everything, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(port_of_embarkation, everything()) %>% #<<
  head(n = 5)
```

---

# Moving columns

When you use `mutate()` to create new variables they are always added after the last column of a dataset. The `mutate()` function does not have an argument for specifying the position of newly created variables in a data frame (see the discussion about this [`dplyr` issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/2047) if you are interested in the background).  

However, in some cases, you might want to have newly created columns in a different place (e.g., closer to the variables they are based on or related to) or want to move one or more columns for some other reason. In some of these cases, it might be inconvenient to do this via `select()`.  

Luckily, someone on [*Stackoverflow*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52096919/move-a-column-conveniently/52096938#52096938) has created a nice function for this situation. You can find the function definition in the `move.R` file in the *scripts* folder.   

---

# Move function

```{r source move function}
source("../../scripts/move.R")
```

```{r move columns, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  move(cols = port_of_embarkation, ref = passenger_id, side = "after")
```

---

# Rearrange the order of rows

To rearrange the order of rows/observations in your dataset, you can use the `arrange()` function from `dplyr`. You can arrange your observations by one or more variables and in ascending or descending order.

---

# Arrange by one variable - ascending

```{r arrange 1 asc, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  arrange(age)
```

---

# Arrange by one variable - descending

```{r arrange 1 desc echo, echo = T, eval = F}
titanic %>% 
  arrange(desc(age))
```

You can also use `-` instead of `desc()` (to save some typing).

```{r arrange 1 desc eval, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  arrange(-age) %>% #<<
  head(n = 5)
```

---

# Arrange by multiple variables

```{r arrange >1, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  arrange(ticket_class, desc(fare)) %>% 
  select(passenger_id, sex, age, ticket_class, fare)
```

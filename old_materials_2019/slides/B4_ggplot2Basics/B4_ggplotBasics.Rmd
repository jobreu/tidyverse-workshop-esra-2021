# Graphics in `R`

Since its early days `R` has always had good capabilities for creating graphics.

A standard `R` installation doesn't require any additional packages to create graphics.

--

```{r load_titanic}
titanic <- 
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv", 
    col_types = cols()
    ) %>% 
  na.omit()
```

.pull-left[
```{r graphics_hist, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
hist(titanic$Age)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "graphics_hist"}
```
]

---

# What is `ggplot2`?

`ggplot2` is another `R` package for creating plots and is part of the `tidyverse`.

--

It uses the *grammar of graphics*

- well-suited for multi-dimensional data

- it expects data (frames) as input

- components of the plot are added as layers

--

```{r plot call, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot_call +
  layer_1 +
  layer_2 +
  ... +
  layer_n
```


---
# `ggplot2` examples

```{r radar fig}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/143_radar_chart_multi_indiv_2.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r density fig}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/21_ggplot2_ddensity_plot.png")
```
]

# Histograms as in base `R`

```{r ggplot_histogram, out.width = "65%"}
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

---

# Components of a plot

According to Wickham (2010, 8)* a layered plot consists of the following components:

<span class="footnote">
<small><small><span class="red bold">*</span> http://dx.doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098</small></small>
</span>

--
- data and aesthetic mappings,

--

- geometric objects,

--

- scales,

--

- and facet specification

--
```{r plot call example, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot_call + #<<
  data + #<<
  aesthetics + #<<
  geometries + #<<
  scales +
  facets
```

---

# Data requirements

You can use one single data frame to create a plot in `ggplot2`.
- everything on the plot is just data
- creates a smooth workflow from data wrangling to the final presentation of the results


```{r data_science_pic, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/data-science_man.png")
```

<small><small>Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz</small></small>

--

However, this makes it difficult to add extra features to your plot.
  - There are ways of doing it anyway
  - Yet, it requires thinking about what to plot

---

# Why the long format? `r ji("horse")`

`ggplot2` prefers data in the long data format (NB: Of course, only if this is possible and makes sense for the dataset at hand)

- in some scientific disciplines this format is only used for specialized analyses (e.g., time series analysis)


.pull-left[
We may want to get used to it as this format has some benefits:

- every element we aim to plot is an observation

- no thinking required how a specific variable relates to an observation

- most importantly, the long format is more parsimonious
    - it requires less memory and less disk space
]


.pull-right[
```{r long_pic, out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/long.png")
```

# Creating your own plot

We do not want to give a lecture on the theory behind data visualization.

- creating plots is all about practice

- ...and 'borrowing' code from others


.column-left-half[
```{r pseudo, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
please +
  no +
  more +
  pseudo +
  code +
  man
```
]

.column-right-half[
Three components are important:

- Plot initiation
- data input
- aesthetics definition
- so-called geoms
]


---
# Plot initiation

.pull-left[
`ggplot()` is the most basic command to create a plot:

```{r ggplot_basic, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_basic"}
```
]

--

**But it doesn't show anything...**


---

# Data input

.pull-left[
As we've already learned `ggplot()` expects data as input

```{r load titanic data, message = F}
titanic <- 
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv", 
    col_types = cols()
    ) %>% 
  na.omit()
```


```{r ggplot_data, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_data"}
```
]

--

**Still nothing there...**


---

# `aes`thetics! 

.pull-left[
`ggplot` requires information about the variables to plot

```{r ggplot_aes, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare) #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_aes"}
```
]

--

**That's a little bit better, right?**


---

# `geom`s!

.pull-left[
Finally, `ggplot` needs information *how* to plot the variables

```{r ggplot_geom, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare) +
  geom_point() #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_geom"}
```
]

--

**A scatter plot!**

---

# Add a line

.pull-left[
We can also add more than one `geom`

```{r ggplot_line, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_line"}
```
]

--

**A smoothed regression line!**

---

# Going further: adding group `aes`thetics

.pull-left[
We can add different colors for different groups in our data

```{r ggplot_group, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(
  data = titanic,
  aes(
    x = Age, 
    y = Fare, 
    color = Sex #<<
    )
  ) +
  geom_point()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_group"}
```
]

---

# Manipulating group `aes`thetics

.pull-left[
We can also change the colors that are used in the plot

```{r ggplot_group_man, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(
  data = titanic,
  aes(
    x = Age, 
    y = Fare, 
    color = Sex
    )
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer( #<<
    palette = "Accent" #<<
    ) #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_group_man"}
```
]

---

# Colors and `theme`s

One particular strength of `ggplot2` lies in its theming capabilities.

--

This topic is rather complex and could easily be enough for a separate workshop.

--

However, `ggplot2` has some built-in theme functions that makes theming a plot fairly easy, e.g.,

- `theme_bw()`
- `theme_dark()`
- `theme_void()`
- etc.

See: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

--

If you want to, you can play around with some of those themes in the exercises for this session.

--

In general, the [`r-color-palettes` repository by Emil Hvitfeldt](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) is a good resource for choosing color palettes in `R`.

---

# A note on manipulations

.pull-left[
Working with combined aesthetics and different data inputs can become cumbersome.

Particularly, plotting similar aesthetics which interfere with the automatic procedures can create conflicts.

Some 'favorites' include:

- Multiple legends

- and various color scales for similar geoms 

- ... and there's more!

# Shortcuts

`ggplot2` is powerful...

- yet, it is admittedly somewhat complicated to use in the beginning

- and it has a steep learning curve

However, there are some conveniet shortcuts that you can use for creating simple plots.

---

# `qplot()` or `quickplot()`

.pull-left[
```{r qplot_example, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
qplot(
  x = titanic$Age, 
  y = titanic$Fare,
  geom = "point"
  )
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "qplot_example"}
```
]

---

# `qplot()` or `quickplot()`

.pull-left[
```{r qplot_example_2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
qplot(
  x = titanic$Age, 
  y = titanic$Fare,
  geom = c("point", "smooth") #<<
  )
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "qplot_example_2"}
```
]

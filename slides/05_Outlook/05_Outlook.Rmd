## Where to go from here?

- working with **strings** with [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/index.html)

- working with **factors** with [`forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)

- working with **times and dates** with [`lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)

- working with **labelled data** with [`haven`](https://github.com/tidyverse/haven) and [`sjlabelled`](https://github.com/strengejacke/sjlabelled) (the latter is not associated with the `tidyverse` but still a great package)

- survey data **analysis** with the [`survey` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html) (also not part of the `tidyverse`)

- **visualization** with [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

- **reporting & publishing** with [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

- **functional programming** with the [`purrr` package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)

There are also chapters on all of these topics in [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) (with the exception of the `sjlabelled` and `survey` packages)

## The expanding `tidyverse`

There is a growing list of packages that implement/adapt `tidyverse` principles and workflows for different types of analyses.  

Some examples:

- [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) for modeling and machine learning using `tidyverse` principles

- [`tidygraph`](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/) for a tidy approach to network analysis

- [`tidytext`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html) for a [tidy approach to text mining](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)

- [`tidybayes`](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/index.html) for tidy Bayesian analyses

All slides were created with the `R` package [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) which builds on [`remark.js`](https://remarkjs.com), [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr), and [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The exercises were created with the [`unilur` package](https://github.com/koncina/unilur).  

Please make sure to properly cite all data that you use for your research (archives usually provide suggested citations). Also make sure to cite the free and open-source software (FOSS) that you use, such as `R` and the packages for it. To know how to do that, you can use the function `citation(packagename)` in `R`.

We thank the ESRA 2021 organizers (especially Marieke Haan), and all of you for participating!

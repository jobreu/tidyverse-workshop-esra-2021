## What is the `tidyverse`?

> The `tidyverse` is an .highlight[opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science]. All packages share an .highlight[underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures] ([Tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).

> The `tidyverse` is a .highlight[coherent system of packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization] that share a .highlight[common design philosophy] ([Rickert, 2017](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/)).

## Benefits of the `tidyverse`

.large[
Most of the things we are going to show you can also be achieved with base `R`. However, the syntax for this is typically (more) verbose and not intuitive and, hence, difficult to learn, remember, and read (plus many `tidyverse` operations are faster than their base R equivalents).
]

---

## Benefits of the `tidyverse`

.large[  
`Tidyverse` syntax is designed to increase **human-readability**. This makes it especially **attractive for `R` novices** as it can facilitate the experience of **self-efficacy** (see [Robinson, 2017](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)). The `tidyverse` also aims for **consistency** (e.g., data frame as first argument and output) and uses **smarter defaults** (e.g., no partial matching of data frame and column names).
]

---

## `tidyverse` for `R` beginners

```{r tidy meme}
meme_get("DistractedBf") %>% 
  meme_text_distbf("tidyverse", "new R users", "base R")
```

---

## Workflow

]
<small><small>Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/</small></small>

.highlight[- **Import**: read in data in different formats (e.g., .csv, .xls, .sav, .dta)
- **Tidy**: clean data (1 row = 1 case, 1 column = 1 variable), rename & recode variables, etc.
- **Transform**: prepare data for analysis (e.g., by aggregating and/or filtering)]
- **Visualize**: explore/analyze data through informative plots
- **Model**: analyze the data by creating models (e.g, linear regression model) 
- **Communicate**: present the results (to others)

## `Tidyverse` workflow

## Lift-off into the `tidyverse` `r ji("rocket")`
**Install all `tidyverse` packages** (for the full list of `tidyverse` packages see [https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/))
```{r install tidyverse, eval = F, echo = T}
install.packages("tidyverse")

```
**Load core `tidyverse` packages** (NB: To save time and reduce namespace conflicts it can make sense to load the `tidyverse` packages individually)
.small[
```{r load tidyverse, eval = T, echo = T, message = T}
library("tidyverse")

```

## Data for this workshop

For this workshop, we will use a synthetic data set based on the data from the [*GESIS Panel Special Survey on the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Germany*](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA5667). This synthetic data set was created by [Bernd Weiß](https://berndweiss.net/) using the [`synthpop` package](https://www.synthpop.org.uk/).

Original data set:

GESIS Panel Team (2020). *GESIS Panel Special Survey on the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Germany*. GESIS Data Archive, Cologne. ZA5667 Data file Version 1.1.0, [https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13520](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13520)

---

## `tidyverse` vocab 101

We will focus on three key things here:

1. Tidy data

2. Tibbles

3. Pipes

---

## Tidy data

The 3 rules of tidy data:

1. Each **variable** is in a separate **column**.

2. Each **observation** is in a separate **row**.

3. Each **value** is in a separate **cell**.

*NB*: In the `tidyverse` terminology 'tidy data' usually also means data in long format (where applicable). 

---

## Wide vs. long format

---

## Tibbles all the way

Tibbles are basically just `R data.frames` but nicer.
- only the first ten observations are printed
  - output is tidier!
- you get some additonal metadata about rows and columns you'd usually only get when, e.g., using `dim()` and other functions

Please refer to this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html) for the technical details.

---

## `tibble()` vs. `data.frame()`

.pull-left[
```{r data-frame}
gpc <-
  read.csv(
    "../../data/ZA5667_v1-0-0_Stata14_synthetic-data.csv"
  )

gpc
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r tibble}
gpc <-
  readr::read_csv(
   "../../data/ZA5667_v1-0-0_Stata14_synthetic-data.csv"
  )

gpc
```

]

---

## Pipes everywhere...

```{r pipe meme, echo = FALSE}
meme_get("OprahGiveaway") %>% 
  meme_text_bottom("EVERYONE GETS A %>%!!!", size = 36)
```

---

## The Logic of Pipes

Usually, in `R` we apply functions as follows:

```{r function-r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
f(x)
```

In the logic of pipes this function is written as:

```{r function-pipe, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% f(.)
```

--

We can use pipes on more than one function:

```{r function-pipe-2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% 
  f_1() %>% 
  f_2() %>% 
  f_3()
```

More details: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html

---

## Resources

There are hundreds of tutorials, courses, blog posts, etc. about the `tidyverse` available online. The book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and [Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/statgarrett) (which is available for free online) provides a very comprehensive introduction to the `tidyverse`.

The weekly [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data projects and the associated [#tidytuesday Twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday?lang=en) are also a fun way of learning and practicing data wrangling and exploration with the `tidyverse`.

---

## Cheat sheets

*RStudio* offers a good collection of [cheat sheets for R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

The following two are of particular interest for this workshop:

- [Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf)

- [Data Transformation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
